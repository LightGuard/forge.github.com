We have a new website, and would like to thank several of our community members for making this possible.

h3. Thanks to...
* *Paul Bakker* - for getting the initial project started and doing the plugin search pages
* *Ivan St. Ivanov* - for migrating the documentation
* *And many more* - for their ideas and help over the past few months.

h3. Getting involved

If you would like to get involved and help with the web site, please feel free to "fork our repository":http://github.com/forge/forge.github.com on github and send pull requests. You will need to "install Awestruct":http://awestruct.org to build and run the website locally (`awestruct -d`).

Good luck and we welcome your feedback!
