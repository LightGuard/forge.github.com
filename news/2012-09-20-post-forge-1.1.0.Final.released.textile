It is with great pleasure that I announce that *JBoss Forge 1.1.0.Final* has just been released ! 

This version is loaded with new features (That's why we decided to change the minor version - :) ). Check out the <a href='https://issues.jboss.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12311820&version=12319934'>Full Release Notes</a> or, if you just want to catch up with what's new, keep reading :

* *SNAPSHOTS ? No siree !!* - Now Forge won't prompt for SNAPSHOT dependencies when you need to choose a dependency.

* *Forge Update* - Yes!!! Now you can update your Forge installation by simply typing <code>forge update</code>. 
Forge will automatically detect the latest version and prompt you for update;

* *Metamodel Generation* - When you run <code>persistence setup</code>, you will now be asked to install a JPA 2 metamodel generator *BASED ON YOUR PERSISTENCE PROVIDER !! :)*
Many thanks to Thomas Hug for making this happen;

* *Class attributes in the right place* - When you create a new field, the newly created attribute will be placed near to the others, and no longer in the end of the class;

* *Improvements to the "Did you mean ?" feature* - If you typed something wrong, Forge will suggest you which command may be similar to what you were looking for. 
Now supporting aliased commands;

* *Plugins Diff* - Now when you install a plugin, Forge will show you the newly available commands, as well the removed commands when you uninstall;

* *open http://www.sesame.com (or _cat_)* - Now you can open any URL inside Forge using <code>open http://forge.jboss.org</code>. 
You can also <code>cat http://forge.jboss.org</code> as well;

* *Colossal changes* to our *most beloved plugins ever* !!!
** *Hibernate-Tools*: Now you can count on a database reverse engineering plugin that supports oracle databases in addition to the plethora of others already included;
** *AS7* : This little piece of love will download, install, start, stop, deploy, undeploy, execute CLI commands *ALL-IN-ONE ! YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO MISS IT !*

and much more ... 

h3. Thanks to...
* *Thomas Hug* - for getting the JPA 2 metamodel generator done
* *Ivan 'The Enforcer' St. Ivanov* - for correctly configuring the maven enforcer plugin and making us relieved while building the sources; 
* *And many more* - for their ideas and help over the past few months.

Also many thanks to everyone who attended the Forge Hack Night. We couldn't have done it without your help !
