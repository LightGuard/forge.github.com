h1. Update your maven dependencies automatically


p. New versions of software are released every day, and it is hard to keep your project up-to-date with the latest version of a dependency declared in your pom.xml
Fortunately, in 1.2.2.Final, JBoss Forge provides a new command to make things easier:

bc(prettyprint).. maven update

p. This command will scan each dependency in your current project and suggest you to update to a newer version, also displaying release notes where applicable.
Here is a video showing how this is possible:

<object width="853" height="480"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/M8yrhqeS6pI?hl=pt_BR&amp;version=3&amp;rel=0"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/M8yrhqeS6pI?hl=pt_BR&amp;version=3&amp;rel=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="853" height="480" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object>

Many thanks to _Aslak Knutsen_ for making this happen.
